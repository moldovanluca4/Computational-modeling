    "\n",
    "#### $\\textbf{Traffic Cellular Automata with Two Lanes}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Nagel–Schreckenberg (NaSch) model is a discrete cellular automaton that describes vehicular traffic flow on a one-dimensional road of length L divided into cells. Each cell can be either empty or occupied by a single vehicle. Each vehicle has a discrete velocity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_i \\in 0,1,...,v_{max}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Discrete space}$: The world is a regular grid of sites. We have a one dimensional road of length L cells, extended to two lanes\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Finite States}$: Each cell has a finite set of possible values. In this case a cell is either empty or occupied by a vehicle. The vehicles have the discrete velocity mentioned above\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Discrete Time}$: The system envolves in discrete time steps\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Local Rules}$: The new state of a cell is determined by rules that depend on its own state and the states of its neighboring cells. In traffic terms this means a vehicles update depends on its own velocity and its distance to the car in front\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Synchronous Updates}$: In each time step the update rules are applied to all vehicles simultaneously based on the state from the previous step\n",
    "\n",
    "##### $\\textbf{Stage 1 : Lane-Chnaging Formulas}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- before any car moves, each vehicle $i$ assesses whether to change to the other lane. t\n",
    "- this decision is based on two criteria, and if both are met, the vehicle changes lanes with probability $p_{lane}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) $\\textbf{Incentive Criterion}$: The car wants to change the lane. This happens if the gap in the new lane ($d_{ahead,new}$) is significantly larger than the gap in its current lane ($d_{ahead}$).$d_{ahead,new} > d_{ahead} + \\Delta$ \n",
    "\n",
    "2) $\\textbf{Safety Criterion}$: The car can change safely. This requires checking the space ahead and behind in the target lane.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Ahead:}$ The gap in the new lane must be larger than the car's current velocity, so it doesn't crash: $d_{ahead,new} > v_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Behind:}$ The lane must be free behind the car. \n",
    "\n",
    "- the principle is that the gap behind ($d_{behind,new}$) must be large enough that the car approaching from behind in the new lane (let's call its velocity $v_{behind}$) will not crash into vehicle $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- a common rule is $d_{behind,new} > v_{behind}$ or, for absolute safety, $d_{behind,new} > v_{max}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $\\textbf{Stage 2: NaSch Movement Formulas}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "- After all lane changes are decided, every car performs the standard four-step NaSch update in parallel. \n",
    "\n",
    "- These rules are applied independently to each lane.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each vehicle $i$ with velocity $v_i$ and gap $d_i$ to the next car in its lane:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Acceleration:}$ $v_i \\leftarrow \\min(v_i + 1, v_{max})$ \n",
    "\n",
    "- if a car is not at its max velocity its speeds up by one unit\n",
    "\n",
    "- Effect: Drivers always try to speed up to the maximum allowed velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Deceleration}$ (Safety): $v_i \\leftarrow \\min(v_i, d_i)$ we can consider it collision avoidance also in some cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- $d_i$ is the gap to the next car ahead\n",
    "\n",
    "- if the gap is smaller than the vehicles current velocity the vehicle must slow down to $d_i$ to avoid a crash\n",
    "\n",
    "- Effect: Drivers brake to avoid collision. If the gap is 3 cells, the velocity cannot be greater than 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Randomization:}$ $v_i \\leftarrow \\max(v_i - 1, 0)$ with probability $p$ \n",
    "\n",
    "- with a give probability p, a vehicle reduces its velocity by one, this simulates random driver behaviour and is key to creating spontaneous jams\n",
    "\n",
    "- Effect: This is the key rule that introduces realism. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It models human imperfections like over-braking, random slowing, or distraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This randomness is what causes spontaneous jams.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Movement:}$ $x_i \\leftarrow x_i + v_i$ \n",
    "\n",
    "- each car moves forward by $v_i$ cells where $v_i$ is the velocity calculated from steps 1 - 3\n",
    "\n",
    "- Effect: The car moves forward by its finally-determined velocity.\n",

    "First, I'll compare the flow-density $J(\\rho)$ plots for the single-lane and two-lane simulations to find the \"critical density\" (where flow is highest). This will tell me if the two-lane road's peak happens at a higher or lower density, showing how overtaking changes the road's capacity. Next, I'll check my lane usage plot (left vs. right lane fractions) to see if the \"pass left, keep right\" rules made one lane get way more crowded as I added more cars, which would be spontaneous lane formation. Finally, I'll connect the dots on random braking: I know the \"pass left\" rule is v_current > v_front and the braking probability p is what makes v_front drop. So, a higher p must change how often cars try to overtake, and I just need to state how."
